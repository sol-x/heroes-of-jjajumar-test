The Heroes of Jjajumar typically eat industrial strength banana flavoured biscuits, but they need a lot of magical energy to fight their enemies for Christmas. For this, their favorite snack is a special type of coconut that only grows deep in the supermarket. The Heroes of Jjajumar have brought you on their annual expedition to the supermarket aisles where the fruit grows.

To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty special coconuts by December 25th 2023. Although the Heroes of Jjajumar assure you that the supermarket has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

The supermarket must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Heroes of Jjajumar traditionally travel on foot. As your boats approach the supermarket, the Heroes of Jjajumar begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of calories each hero is carrying (your puzzle input).

The Heroes of Jjajumar take turns writing down the number of calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Hero of Jjajumar separates their own inventory from the previous Hero's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the Heroes of Jjajumar finish writing their items' calories and end up with the following list:

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Heroes of Jjajumar:

The first Hero of Jjajumar is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.
The second Hero of Jjajumar is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.
The third Hero of Jjajumar is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.
The fourth Hero of Jjajumar is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.
The fifth Hero of Jjajumar is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.
In case the Heroes of Jjajumar get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Hero of Jjajumar to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Hero of Jjajumar carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Hero of Jjajumar).
